# twitter_sentiment_challenge | FF remake | Applying it to alueducation tweets
See credit below to Siraj Raval and Cristalee.

I analyzed just 100 tweets from alueducation, between May 1 - 17 2018.

##My conclusions
When I did this exercise with the ALU tweets, I learnt two things: 
A - Fred Swaniker is the master twitter about ALU. Why is it that students and the rest of the community don't tweet much abnout what's happening there?
B - I learnt that there's a very neutral sentiment attached to ALU. Perhaps there could be more human, happy, fun stories about the place, shared by the +500 students who live there!


##Overview

This is the code for the Twitter Sentiment Analyzer challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #2' by @Sirajology on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/o_OZdbCzHUA). The code uses the [tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/)  library to access the Twitter API and the [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. We'll be able to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose. 

##Dependencies

* tweepy (http://www.tweepy.org/)
* textblob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

Install missing dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

##Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via

```
python demo.py
```

##Challenge

Instead of printing out each tweet, save each Tweet to a CSV file with an associated label. The label should be either 'Positive' or 'Negative'. You can define the sentiment polarity threshold yourself, whatever you think constitutes a tweet being positive/negative. Push your code repository to [github](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) then post it in the comments. I'll give the winner a shoutout a week from now!

This code is 100% Siraj baby. and Cristalee whose code I got inspired by.
